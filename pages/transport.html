			<h2>Getting There</h2>
			<p> As the venue is out in the whops, transport might be an issue for some people. The Dharma shed is about 20 minutes drive from Blenheim so it is fairly accessible from there.</p>
			<p> We will be running a shuttle services to transport people form Blenheim to the Dharma Shed. Check the timetable below, and if you are interested in booking a seat, please let us know via the 
			<a href="/contact.html">contact page</a></p>
			<h2> The Return Trip</h2>
			<p> In terms of returning to Blenheim we have several options. If only a handful of people will be needing a ride back to Blenheim on the night, we will organise a shuttle to do a few loads back. </p>
			<p> If there is a large number of people interested in a ride back into Blenheim (with the new alcohol laws this is advisable) we would organise several shuttles to do trips at 9.30pm, 11pm, and one sometime around midnight. Again, please let us know how you will be leaving so we can organise transport for those who need it.</p>
			<p> Please also remember that the Dharam Shed has plenty of lovely fields for tenting, car sleeping, and potentially space in the shed itself for those who want to just camp out and enjoy the stars.</p>
